# Snake Client Project

A terminal-based Snake implementation written in Node.js. Works alongside [snek-multiplayer](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer.git) server. Max idle-time is 2.5 seconds between the commands the server recieves.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
