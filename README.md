# Snake Client Project

A terminal-based Snake implementation written in Node.js. Works alongside [snek-multiplayer](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer.git) server. Max idle-time is 2.5 seconds between the commands the server recieves.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here. 


## Clone from repository
* git clone https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer.git
* cd snek-multiplayer
# install and run via npm
* npm install
* npm run play

## Acknowledgements
```- This project was not built from scratch. It was inspired and started from [snek]. [https://github.com/taniarascia] is the original author.``` 

## Rules

# Get your snake to move -
We have implemented the WASD to make the snake move.

* w - moves up
* a - moves left
* s - moves down 
* d - moves Right

## Keys that send canned messages -
* use h to say ``` Hello ```
* use b to say ``` Bye bye ```

## Getting Started

- Follow steps inside the snek server repo to run the server side
- Run the development snake client using the `node play.js` command.
